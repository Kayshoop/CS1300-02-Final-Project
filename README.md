# CS1300-02-Final-Project
In this project, your group will create a fully functional website consisting of 4 pages. This is an opportunity to apply all the skills youâ€™ve learned throughout the course, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control with Git. Your website will be deployed online via GitHub Pages, allowing you to showcase your work to others.
